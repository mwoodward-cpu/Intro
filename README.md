# Research

This repository is an ongoing investigation of my current research involving learning the right hand side of an ordinary
differential equation describing molecular dynamics. The goal is start with a simple example, using both neural ode and 
SINDy and eventually extend these results for reduced order modelling via SPH and deep learning. Given simulation data, the goal is to
develop a pipline for learning the dynamics in both N_ode and SINDy.  

***WARNING***
This code is a work in progress. 

See the repository on /applying_neural_ode for working code.
